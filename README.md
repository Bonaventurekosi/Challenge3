Coding Challenge 3
For this challenge, you are required to write a program that takes an array of integers and a target
sum. The program should determine if there exists a subset of the array whose elements add up to the
target sum.
Requirements:
1. Input an array of integers and a target sum.
2. Output whether there exists a subset of the array elements that adds up to the target sum.
3. If such a subset exists, print out the subset.


So here we have set the target sum to 10 and the array we provided is [1,3,5,0,11,17,9,5]
Output: Since 1 and 9 are the two numbers in the array which add up to 10, hence the program prints
out that such a subset exists and prints it out.

You can use the above example to test your code!
Submit your code with your output commented out at the end of your code. You are free to
use C, C++, C#, Python or Java to implement this program.
Please upload your code to GitHub and submit the GitHub link for the same in a word
document with your name on Canvas under the ‘Assignments’ tab.
